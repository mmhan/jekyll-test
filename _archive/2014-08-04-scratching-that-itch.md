Yes, it’s me again, on my bi-annual visit to my own blog. It is as if I had this medical condition that makes me want to write and it builds up. At the stage which the mind can no longer bear, symptoms starts to show like my hands started typing in the air and I keep pressing with my hand on the word “Publish” every time I see it.

I’m not too sure if there’s a medical term for that condition. <sup id="fnref:note-symptoms">[1](#fn:note-symptoms)</sup> According to the recent statistics, it takes about half a year to accumulate to this stage for me to make another blog post. Again, according the the stats, it should be expected that I will go back to my hidings once that itch to write has been scratched.

A recent article, that I have shared, “[How a password changed my life](https://medium.com/@manicho/how-a-password-changed-my-life-7af5d5f28038)” illustrated how a person who started using the password as a self-fulfilling prophecy and a gentle reminder to achieve his goals. <sup id="fnref:note-sharing">[2](#fn:note-sharing)</sup>

Like a child who’s easily impressed by something new, I will be adopting the author’s method and start a goal for this month of “Get back to writing”. <sup id="fnref:note-password">[3](#fn:note-password)</sup> So, there may or may not be a periodical increase of blog posts published in these few weeks, before the inspiration wears thin and I settle back to my typical posting frequency, as I naturally do. Besides, it’s not as if anybody is reading these posts anyway. This blog is more like a remote quiet zen of my internet identity.

Below are a few things that I had taken a mental note to write about:

*   “Being a programmer, for real”, the topic that I spoke about, in Mandalay MCPA event on 27th July
*   How I had came to speak about that topic.
*   How I feel that the topic’s bottom line in general is applicable in most actions/skills.
*   My indulgement and experiences in stretching its applicability.
*   Meta-thinking in general.
*   How I have come to absolutely hate that aforementioned topic. (Considering it may take 3 years of writing to get this list checked off.)

Besides that, I have recently celebrated my 26th birthday. Yes, I am getting old. My receding hairline is a testament to that. I have read it in Facebook that “according to a medical research, it has been found that the people who celebrates more birthdays live a longer life”. ([Ba dum tss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zXDo4dL7SU)!) I knew that it was meant to be a joke. However, following the trend of people sharing and liking facebook statuses to cure some kid of cancer or distributing water to Africa, I gave my inferior naive mind a pass and let him take that research literally; celebrating not one, not two but three birthdays. One with my family, another with my colleagues and last, but not least, with my significant other.

That last bit provided me with a great segue to the next update, I’ll be getting married to the love of my life and the childhood friend since kindergarten at the end of the year. We wanted it to be least tasking logistically and financially to our parents and most subtly non-traditional. Naturally, it involves lots and lots of work to bring the whole thing together. So take this as my excuse if I didn’t continue writing.

I’m always proud of our relationship, and delighted to hear that people go “Awwwwwww…” when we mentioned that we have known each other since we were 4\. I have to admit though that I slightly feel I don’t deserve it at times. It’s like what they say “Your life’s first few years are like the nights you drunk too much. You drool, you piss in your pants, you speaks gibberish and you only knew what happened in those years (or nights) only because people told you about it.”. So, let me make a smug note to those couples who are enviously inventing your own story of how you have known each other since you were kids like us, your efforts are seriously misguided. And… pics or it never happened!

That’s it for the day. Ciao!

1.  Perhaps some of the doctor friends will kindly point out the name of that condition. [↩](#fnref:note-symptoms "Jump back to footnote 1 in the text")<a name="fn:note-symptoms"></a>
2.  Because why come up with your own thoughts and write about it when you can get free thoughts instantly online. [↩](#fnref:note-sharing "Jump back to footnote 2 in the text")<a name="fn:note-sharing"></a>
3.  Wipe that smirk off your face you wise-ass, that’s definitely not how I phrased my password. [↩](#fnref:note-password "Jump back to footnote 3 in the text")<a name="fn:note-password"></a>
