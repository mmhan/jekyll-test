<p>Due to series of unfortunate events (in real life) I found myself back at home at 4 am in the morning so hyper-active with no intention at all to sleep. I thought hell, what other use for this kind of hyperactivity than updating my poor blog theme.</p>
<p>I proudly presents you with Comicalistic 0.5.5. Although there isn't too much of new features on this theme, it certainly has just gone through a few "major" fixes for cross browser usability.</p>
<p>Read more to find out more about the updates and the new comic strip for IE 6 users.<!--more--></p>
<p>The following is the break down of the updates that I've made.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed PNG transparency problem (by replacing the pngs with non-anti-aliazed gif transparent images using IE 6 conditional comments)</li>
<li>And layout problems for Internet Explorer 6 for some idiots who still use that. (that does not include you if you're viewing it using IE6 only because your idiotic company didn't update the browser)</li>
<li>Changed "mmhan" word of blog's logo to the logo that I intend to use for myself.</li>
<li>Updated the speech bubble.</li>
<li>Added conditional speech bubble especially for IE6</li>
<li>Fixed big ass textarea of Post comment section for Safari</li>
</ul>
<p>And these few are some updates that I've made along the way since the launch,</p>
<ul>
<li>Added subscribe to comments</li>
<li>Added socialable plugin for sharing (although I doubt anyone would use that)</li>
<li>Updated comments layout with Gravatars for the comment author</li>
</ul>
<p>I've just got myself 2000th unique visitor last few days ago, and I'm so glad that for such a small blog without regular updates as mine, I've received that much traffic.</p>
<p>Since the launch of this blog, I intended that <strong>I'll only post the posts that are of somewhat value to my readers</strong>. I've found myself canceling and reworking the post ideas and it repeats again and again so much that the blog posts are so much apart from each other. And being so busy at work and many other stuffs hasn't been helping either.</p>
<p>As I had promised, I have so many drafts and ideas that I would like to work out for posts and all I need is a little time, and I'll deliver them right next to you whenever I'm available.</p>
<p>I've always been checking my inbox for new comments and new queries from contact me, I'd be glad to hear from you guys for any question or tips for posts and stuffs that you'd like other readers to know. A quick and easy way is the <a href="http://mmhan.net/contact-me/">Contact Form</a> and it's just one click away.</p>
<p>Anyway check out the first comic that I had on this blog if you missed it.</p>

<p>And the comic that's only viewable by IE 6 users.</p>

<p>Cheers! :D</p>
