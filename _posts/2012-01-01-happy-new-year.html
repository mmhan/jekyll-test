<p>Happy New Year to you. I'm sure you have had yourself a good time yesterday and thinking of your resolutions and what not at the first day of the year.</p>
<p><em>Just a little disclaimer, this is not a post coming from just another new year resolution.</em></p>
<!--more-->
<p>Firstly, I'm glad to be back. I have been away due to many commitments. It was also partly because of the feeling that nothing I ever wrote about had any real value for those who read it.</p>
<p>I'm back now. It is mostly because I have been finding myself taking notes on things that are worth repeating.</p>
<p>Besides I want to improve my writings in both English and Burmese. What other way someone like me has to pursue such a wish than blogging.</p>
<p>You might notice I have updated the theme. It's my own mix of <a title="Go to theme site" href="http://kitmacallister.com/2011/brunelleschi/" target="_blank">Brunelleschi</a>. It's a pretty good theme with good typography, clean and responsive design. Check it out if you like it.</p>
<p>In a very very brief manner, below is a non-exhaustive list of the things that I had been doing while I was away, in nonsensical order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recently decided to move to VIM from notepad++ and Aptana IDE (still in transition stage)</li>
<li>Finished my <a title="My Degree Study" href="http://mmhan.net/writings/my-degree-study/">Bachelor degree in Computer Science</a> and Business Information System from Murdoch University</li>
<li>Found how awesome Git is and have been using a lot of github and bitbucket.</li>
<li>Still a proud employee of Comwerks Interactive, now a part of WPP.</li>
<li>Launched an experimental site called <a href="http://muzicdb.com" target="_blank">MuzicDB</a>, for Burmese music.</li>
<li>Voluntarily or involuntarily, meddled with C, C++, Qt, Objective-C, Python, CoffeeScript and sass. I still am meddling with some of them and many more to come.</li>
<li>Wasting computing cycles on EC2 under the free-tier plan.</li>
<li>Organized three talk events inviting Burmese authors back from the country for the fellow Burmese at Singapore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that's all I could think of as of this moment. There may or may not be follow-up posts about these things. But I can assure you all that, there shall be posts.</p>
<p>So do look forward.</p>
