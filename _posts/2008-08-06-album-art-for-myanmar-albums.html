<p>Even though I don't own an iPod or an iPhone, when it comes to the Album Art, I'm so keen to find 'em and add 'em to many albums I have. I just feels like these album art kinda make a visual connection between the album and me. And as many might know, there aren't any site that's dedicated to provide album arts of good quality without their copyright notice. And there, I kinda have that cool idea to create the album art by myself.<!--more--></p>
<p>Hence, I've been creating album arts on my own using some relevant graphics for the sake of eye candy. Being it helps in a way improving graphic editing &amp; composition skills, I've taken the initiative to create <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/mm-album-arts/pool/">user-generated album art group @ Flickr</a> and I'd like to extend the invite to everyone to come in an participate in this group.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, the following are some of the Album Arts that I've previously created using CC graphics/photos from Flickr. I'll upload more as soon as I get the permission for other album arts that I had created using copyrighted materials since this idea was initially a personal project.</p>

<p>Feel free to grab 'em for your music library (do leave a comment if you like 'em or curse at me if you hate 'em). And do leave a comment if you think you can moderate and contribute to the Flickr Group.</p>
