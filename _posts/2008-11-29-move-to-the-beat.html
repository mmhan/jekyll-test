<p>I'm not sure if you guys have heard about my project, Move to the Beat, a game based on the animated movie, <strong>Sing to the Dawn</strong>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Sing to the Dawn is a movie by Infinite Frameworks, backed by Media Development Authority Singapore. This movie is based on award winning novel and produced "locally" here in Singapore.</p>
<p>This project was done as my final year project in one semester time, creating rhythm based game using flash. I was responsible for programming of the game engine and compiling all the assets given to me. Even though this project was already finished since last year's December, its release has been delayed to accompany the release of the movie.</p>
<p>Oh well, enough talking. Click the link below to take a jump to the game page on <a href="http://singtothedawn.com/">Sing to the Dawn</a> movie's site and have fun.</p>
