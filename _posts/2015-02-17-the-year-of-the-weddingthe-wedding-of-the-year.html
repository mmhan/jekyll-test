<p><em>Yes, my bi-annual blog post is two months overdue. But here goes.</em></p>
<p>It's the year of the wedding, the year that Rachel and I spent most of our time trying to plan the wedding of the year. To tell you the story about that wedding, we must go back a couple of years.</p>
<p>It was a peaceful and quiet evening in the neighborhood of Chua Chu Kang, sitting upon a bench of a park that we were in a muse about the ideal time for us to get married. It's only a few months in the relationship, in fact that was one of those monthniversaries. Pretty early to be having that conversation, but I obliged to the day dream as one of the activities of young couples.</p>
<p>Much later, in the March of 2014, when I proposed to Rachel, at the birthday of her favorite neice, the wedding plan is already in place. Choosing my own design for the ring and everything I got it all worked out. The neice, Avery, was to hand her the ring. As god laughed while we the mere mortals were making plans, Avery wasn't old enough to be able to proceed according to the plan. Besides, Rachel could see the proposal coming from a millenium away.</p>
<p>As December came around as fast as I moved along this story, registeration of marriage with close friends and donation, at a peaceful lakeside monastery, proceeded the hotel reception. At the reception, a photobooth of sort with great illustrations as backdrop and a special video montage was a gift for the both of us by the altruistic Nyi Lin Han and greenbox team. With two wonderful MCs of Phyo Thiha Aung and Min Nyan Lin it went as smoothly and as merrily as it can be.</p>
<p>By the end of all the proceedings though, we are all flat out tired and it's a wonder we were still upright with uncountable glasses of liquors.</p>
<p>And here you have it, your same old Mike, but as a wedded old man.</p>
