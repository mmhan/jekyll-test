<p>On 21st April, the video named Raffles Place Ghost hit the internet via YouTube. It's a security footage in which the "ghost" was captured. <!--more-->Have a look at it at the player below.</p>
<div class="aligncenter" style="width: 460px;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="460" height="374" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/poSYwC0jx5E&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="460" height="374" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/poSYwC0jx5E&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div>
<p>The video was spread out across the island of Singapore in days from mouth to mouth news and it was mentioned not only in various local news on and off screen but also in Channel News Asia, a renowned news center of Asia.</p>
<p>Finally, the champs behind the video came out from behind the curtain and surprised the world with the message of the video with the following video.</p>
<div class="aligncenter" style="width: 460px;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="460" height="372" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/QcjB_taiThk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="460" height="372" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/QcjB_taiThk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div>
<p>As you could see from the video, it actually was a viral marketing video. It cost the recruitment and HR consultancy group GMP just $100K for the delivery of the message to targeted consumer.</p>
<p>With interest in new media from the business owners and the consumers are at rise, I believe there are many more to come and I can't wait see them in action.</p>
