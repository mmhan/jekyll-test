<p>This isn't an article that's so much as intended for those in the internet industry, it reads more like it's for those who are not tech-savvy enough to know the lengths that the companies go to ensure their site speed is faster.</p>
<p>However this line below caught my eyes</p>
<blockquote><p>People will visit a Web site less often if it is slower than a close competitor by more than 250 milliseconds.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now they are ultra-demanding customers we are trying to serve.</p>
<p>Every cowboy-programmer should take note that an extra iteration here, unnecessary API call there and a block of HTML comments that should have been deleted, could easily take up that 250ms and affect your business.</p>
