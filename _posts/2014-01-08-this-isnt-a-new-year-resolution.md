No, it really isn't.

It's a funny thing, a new year. Everytime I had to look at the calendar orÂ correct the date I put down in a form, the strange figure of the year figure reminds one to reflect on things. A reminder that rings loudly to one's mind that "Dude! it has been almost a year since you last reflected on things". That made me realized that my bi-annually blog posts are the results of these reminders. (Perhaps I should keep that in mind too, when I choose my next hosting provider, since each post that I made cost half of their yearly plan. But I digress.)

I would have ticked all of the choices below when I am asked to reflect my 2013.

1.  An excellent year.
2.  A good year.
3.  A trying year.
4.  A challenging year.

This was the year that I first got the taste of full-time entrepreneurship. This was the year at which my relationship to my SO suffers LDR syndrome. This was the year that I am brought back to earth by facing the realities of Myanmar in first-person as an adult (being I left at 16). This was the year at which my family is at its most trying stage. And in a lighter note, this was the year at which the boys at Arsenal start to live up to the expectation and the same year at which I have no access to Premier League live shows subscription.

For as long as a year is, I have no problem giving no rating to my year. It definitely has its ups and downs, but my optimistic and grateful mind is readily accepting it's one of the best years.

Nope, this isn't the part where I start to list down stuffs I wanna get done this year. That's just too mainstream.

And nope, there's nothing more I need saying. This is me just relieving my guilty conciousness of not reflecting on a new year.

This is Mike signing off and looking forward to more exciting years ahead.
