<p>Yes, indeed.</p>
<p>I wanted to create a very very cool website as neat as <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>'s site, as advanced as <a href="http://2advanced.com">2advanced.com</a> or as sophisticated as <a href="http://lifehacker.com">lifehacker.com</a>.</p>
<p>On the way, I thought, I ain't no Apple or 2advanced. Hell, I'm just a Joker who loves fun &amp; seriousness at the same time.(no pun intended.)</p>
<p>So, I sat down to imagine myself how I would look like if I were a cartoon character. Then I sketched up myself in a comical way, and after four long months of dilly dally-ing I have finally managed to launch this blog.</p>
<p>And yes, I condemn Internet Explorer 6, as a frustrated Web developer and if you're using it, this blog will look like hell. So, go ahead and download some "real" browsers. I suggest <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>. But don't believe me, many are good, as long as it doesn't have an "e" which sounds "shit" in Myanmar, for a logo.</p>
<p>Although, in my heart, I know that I love to write stuffs - even love to be criticized or laughed when I'm wrong - I can't promise at the moment, I could be posting daily.</p>
<p>So, I suggest, you guys <a href="http://mmhan.net/feed/">subscribe</a> to this blog and drop by when you see something new.</p>
<p>You don't know how to subscribe? Well, go to hell man, I ain't going to tell you. hehe, I'm just messing with ya, don't get mad at me, alright?</p>
<p>Now what are you waiting for, have a look around and <a href="http://mmhan.net/news/site-news/mmhan-has-gone-comical/#respond">start throwing rocks at me</a> about stuffs you think I should improve.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>- mmhan</p>
