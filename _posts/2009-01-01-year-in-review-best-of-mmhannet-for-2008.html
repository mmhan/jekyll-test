<p>First of all, Happy New Year to you all. It's been 5 months that I've been posting at this blog and I've posted a total of 40 posts (including <a href="http://mmhan.net/articles/current-affairs/a-visit-to-gtc-thanlyin/">some</a> <a href="http://mmhan.net/articles/current-affairs/the-flat-world-and-myanmar/">posts</a> <a href="http://mmhan.net/uncategorized/big-bag-a-song-gone-wrong/">that</a> <a href="http://mmhan.net/articles/current-affairs/hip-hop-a-new-media/">I've</a> <a href="http://mmhan.net/tips/bypass-blogspot-from-myanmar-google-reader/">immigrated</a> from my old blog) over that period. I must admit 40 is considerably low number of posts over 5 months yet, I'm quite grateful and glad that I've gathered over 6K hits from everywhere. And I'd like to take this chance to thank every reader, commenter, rss subscriber and referrer for their generous support, ever since <a href="http://mmhan.net/news/site-news/mmhan-has-gone-comical/">my first post here</a>, of motivation for me to keep writing.</p>
<p>So here comes the top ten posts of mmhan.net based on hits.<!--more--></p>
<h3>10 - Tagboard <span class="mm">မ်ားႏွင့္ ကၽြန္ေတာ္ ျမန္မာ</span> Blogger</h3>
<p>It's actually quite a surprise to see this post receiving even a tenth place in this list as this post actually is a post describing why I've stopped using Tagboard or CBox in this blog in the hope that I could help reducing tagboard spamming which is happening a lot in Burmese bloggers. Whether if it did help, I'm not sure, but it was controversial enough to get some traffic.</p>

<h3>9 - 5 Tips on How to Get Over Depression</h3>
<p>This is the first ever actual post that I've written on mmhan.net. Since those that's published before this post are a few posts immigrated from my old blog, and an announcement post of the launch of the blog. And I'm quite glad that it has made to this list so that I get the chance to reemphasize this again. We, the kids who had to leave their family and their mother country at a very young age, tend to have depression over things from time to time and I've posted this in the hope that I could help out a handful of us to get over it.</p>

<h3>7 - Favtape.com:My favorite online jukebox (so far)</h3>
<p>Favtape.com is an online music jukebox which nicely keep lists of some greatest hits and play the hits on the browser for you without  any limitation or download. In this post, I mentioned about the site, how it's working at the background and how to download songs directly from that website easily.</p>

<h3>2 - Okto: A new traditional TV channel for Singapore with a sort-of New approach</h3>
<p>A post mentioning about a new TV channel for Singapore and its user generated content programs. This certainly has been quite a hit from search engines for some reasons that I can understand. And this is the only post in this list with ZERO comment count until today for laughing out loud.</p>

<h3>1 - GTalk Bomber <span class="mm">ရဲ႕ spam ဒါဏ္ ခံျပီးျပီလား</span>?</h3>
<p>A program called GTalk Bomber bombarded burmese GTalk users' community spamming everyone to use that program which supposedly will allow you to send a message to everyone in your contact list with a few clicks. This post tried to warn many Gtalk users of the consequences in using this application. And it has been circulated among many Burmese websites so that it generated a spike in traffic with the highest peak of 2.5K unique visits for the month of September for a pathetically small site as mmhan.net.</p>

<h3>To Conclude</h3>
<p>Even though, I've never said it as many of you have imagined, I've been writing with a specific target in mind even though it can't be easily defined by myself.</p>
<p>However complicated it may be, I guess I could say my objective is:</p>
<p>"<em>Amidst the thousands of blogs and hundreds of Burmese blog, I'd like you, my dear reader to have gained a teeny tiny bit of knowledge or awareness that could come in handy in your daily life from reading a post that I've cooked up.</em>"</p>
<h3>Lemme hear ya!</h3>
<p>Now, if you've cared enough to read until this point, <strong>I'd love to hear your frank and respectable opinion of how I'm doing at achieving at this objective and your suggestion on how I could do better at it</strong>. Leave a comment, will ya?</p>
<p>Happy New Year again and all the best wishes to every single one of you.</p>
<p>May you be a much better you in every aspect by the end of 2009.</p>
<p>- mmhan</p>
<p>P.S.: I've also changed the speech bubble of my character above a few days ago in case you didn't notice. :D</p>
