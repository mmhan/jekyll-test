<p>What's the meaning of this sad song, I wondered. Then I looked up and there I found it.</p>
<blockquote><p>"It's about two childhood friends. The type of childhood friend that is the opposite sex, but are so close to. But the complications of love and lust have not yet developed. Their friendship was simple. They'd spend the night at each other's houses and it wasn't a big deal. They grow up and fall in love with each other. But somewhere, things began to get complicated as they grew up and they lost touch without even realizing it....I'm too hard at work, have you ever heard of anything so absurd? He's saying that it's not an excuse to lose something so precious over something so ridiculous. Now, their friendship is nothing...they let it slip away."</p></blockquote>
<p>The lyrics goes like this:<!--more--></p>
<p>You. You were a friend. You were a friend of mine I let you spend the night<br />
You see how it was my fault. Of course it was mine.<br />
I'm too hard at work. Have you ever heard of anything so absurd ever in your life.<br />
I'm sorry for wasting your time.</p>
<p>Who am I to say this situation isn't great? It's my job to make the most of it<br />
Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me. Not that easy.</p>
<p>Hey what's that you say? You're not blaming me for anything that's great<br />
But I don't break that easy. Does it fade away?<br />
So that's why I'm apologizing now for telling you I thought that we could make it<br />
I just don't get enough to believe that we've both changed.</p>
<p>Who am I to say this situation isn't great? It's my time to make the most of it<br />
How could I ever know that this would happen to me, not that easy, no<br />
All along the fault is up for grabs why don't you have it<br />
Well it's for sale go make your offer, I'll sell it for no less than what I bought it for<br />
Pay no more than absolutely zero.</p>
<p>Well neither one of us deserves the blame because opportunities moved us away<br />
And it's not an easy thing to learn to play a game that's made for two that's you and me<br />
The rules remain a mystery. See it can be easy.</p>
<p>Who am I to say this situation isn't great? It's our time to make the most of it<br />
How could we ever know that this would happen to me, not that easy, no<br />
All along the fault is up for grabs and there you have it<br />
Well it's for sale go make your offer, I'll sell it for no less than what I bought it for<br />
Pay no more than absolutely zero.</p>
