<blockquote>
<p>Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups. <small class="author">â€” George Carlin</small> Smash the uncivilized and the disorganized together. Blend those dishonorables and the anarchists. Mix well together and present it on . . . a biased media feeding the frenzy of unsophisticated public. For best result, choose the "If you're not with us you are against us" . . . from the vineyard of False dichotomy. (No, it doesn't matter which year.) There you have your recipes for disaster.</p>
