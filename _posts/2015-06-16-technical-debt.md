excerpt: A rumbling about the technical debt one incurs in the name of progress.

![Technical Debt](/assets/tech-debt.png)

Dear God of the zeroes and ones, grant me the serenity to accept the bits I cannot change,  
The `w+` to change the things I can,  
And `writeable?` method to know the difference.

Coding one block at a time,  
Enjoying one pass at a time,  
Accepting technical debt as a pathway to progress,  
Making it work, as anyone did.

This sinful world as it is,  
Not as I would have it,  
Trusting that thereâ€™ll eventually be a time for Making it right/fast.  
If I surrender to Your will,  
So that I may be reasonably happy in this project,  
And supremely happy with You forever in the next.  
Amen.
