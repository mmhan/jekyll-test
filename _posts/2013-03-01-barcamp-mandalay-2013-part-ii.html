<p><em>Due to my schedule and my forgetfulness, I must beg forgiveness from two of you out there who read my blog and have been waiting for the Part II. I have half-written this post and totally forgotten about it. </em></p>
<p>This is the second part of the post about BarCamp Mandalay 2013. I had booked the 11:00 am to 12:00 pm schedule to talk about 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.</p>
<p>The session before me was the session about speaking good English, a lecture given by an English lecturer from Mandalay University. I arrived early and joined the previous session, which was very popular that they had to add another row of chairs just to fit everyone. Once it was over, it was my turn.</p>
<p>I started by writing the title of the session "7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Steven Covey. I did a brief explanation about what I was gonna talk about and there it goes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Either by contradicting myself or following the traditions of BarCamp, I didn't plan ahead well enough to fit all of the habits well enough into the 45 minutes. Typical!</p>
<p>If having to add in yet another row of chairs for the audience is a sign, I must say it was a well-received presentation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since I didn't prepare any materials for this presentation, I do not have any artifacts to share except to send you in the right direction if you ever wanted to read the books.</p>
