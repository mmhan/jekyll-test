<p>It's now the weekend, as I sit with my trusty laptop in a coffeeshop with its tables and chairs made of reclaimed timber. It feels like a hangover of a week. A week that started out crazy, which turned into such a let-down by mid-week and ended with a meh.<!--more--></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" alt="shirts" src="assets/shirts.jpg" width="400" height="533" />First thing first, I was going to take a part in the event that was supposed to have happened last month. Unfortunately, the event was postponed so much that it no longer become an effective thing to be done. Hence, we have cancelled out the event. Now there sits a pile of T-shirts, that I have designed for the event sits carelessly in one corner of the office.</p>

<p>It was pointed out to me that I really find it hard to let go of things when it comes to delegating tasks. In other words, I am particularly anal when it comes to many things. It's strange because it was merely days before that, I was writing <a title="သက္ျပင္း" href="http://mmhan.net/writings/%e1%80%9e%e1%80%80%e1%80%b9%e1%80%bb%e1%80%95%e1%80%84%e1%80%b9%e1%80%b8/">this short note as a relief to my frustration</a> at accepting that some of the things from my circle of concerns aren't really the things that are in my circle of influence. I guess, I will have to try to be more proactive about these things.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are some schedules that I am going to have to keep and some things that are going to have to change.</p>
<p>I. Must. Be. Proactive.</p>
