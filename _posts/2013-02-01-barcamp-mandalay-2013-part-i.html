<p>After attending and speaking at BarCamp Yangon for the first time ever, I couldn't get enough of the energy, the people and the atmosphere of BarCamp. Having originally intended to go to Mandalay BarCamp even before I have come back from Singapore, it made it easier to decide to attend Mandalay BarCamp.</p>
<p>It was a cozier and much more tightly knitted BarCamp. I was speaking the same topic of Introduction to MVC and CakePHP. However, learning from the experience, I had went in to this session better prepared: with a bag of candies (rewards for those who participate in discussions or raise questions) and the decision to change my plan and the presentation topic according to the audience who attended. I tried a less formal way of engaging the audience and spoke mainly in layman terms and thankfully, I reckon they have at least learnt something new by the end of the day.</p>
<p>I guess I learnt something new that day too: Never assume to know who your audience are, engage with them to really know who they are.</p>
<p>Anyway, for those of you who attended the session and wanted the slides, check it out in <a title="BarCamp Yangon 2013" href="http://mmhan.net/professional/barcamp-yangon-2013/">the post I made for BarCamp Yangon</a>.</p>
