<p>A few days ago I happened to watch this video again after watching <a href="http://vimeo.com/1084537">Big Buck Bunny</a>. Both Elephants Dream and Big Buck Bunny are the short films of world's first "Open Movie" projects which uses Blender, an open-source 3D modeling and animation software, by Blender Organization. View the movie after the jump. (for those who might be wondering, it means click the picture or "Read the rest of the Entry Â»" read more)</p>

<a href="http://vimeo.com/1132937?pg=embed&amp;sec=1132937">Elephants Dream</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user508904?pg=embed&amp;sec=1132937">Blender Foundation</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com?pg=embed&amp;sec=1132937">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>After watching the video for the second time, I found out that I'm just another Proog who's just trying to make a conversation of what's so good about this website, how useful is that application and what's so fun and exciting about a new gadget that to many friends of mine and the responses from many people at the end of my conversation are so much similar to that of Emo.</p>
<p>Too bad I can't beat them up at the end of the story just like Proog did. (just kidding) ;)</p>
<p>Looks like I need to come up with many other stuffs to talk about other than Movies and Web2.0.</p>
<p>How about you my dear reader? Are you Emo or Proog?</p>
