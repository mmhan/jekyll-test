<p><strong>Slacker Uprising</strong>, a documentary by Michael Moore, calling millions of non-voting "slackers" - mostly between the ages of 18-29 - to give voting a try will be released online via <a href="http://slackeruprising.com">SlackerUprising.com</a> on September 23rd. Michael Moore is well-known for his serious and controversial documentary films: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386032/">Sicko</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361596/">Fahrenheit 9/11</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310793/">Bowling for Columbine</a>, presented in a humorous manner.</p>
<p>This movie features his tour across America where thousands of "slackers" turn up to see Michael and his company, including bands, comedians and other speakers. The "slackers" who attended the tours were offered <strong>a clean change of underwear, Ramen noodles, and a promise that no event would start before noon and no politician would be allowed to speak</strong>. (<em>Now, ain't that a great incentive or what?</em>)<!--more--></p>
<p>The press release from the site explaining the reason behind distributing the movie for free, is quoted below:</p>
<blockquote><p>"This is being done entirely as a gift to my fans. The only return any of us are hoping for is the largest turnout of young voters ever at the polls in November." â€“ Michael Moore</p></blockquote>
<p>It's quite visible that Michael Moore, not only wanted his movie to be a success but also want it to reach as much audience as possible in US before the voting start never minding the profit that he could gain from the movie.</p>
<p>In October 2007, Radiohead, an English alternative rock band made such move by selling their latest album, <a href="http://www.inrainbows.com/">In Rainbows</a> online with a price which the customer get to choose. They sold 1.2 million copies of the album on the day of release and charted No#1 in both US and UK soon afterwards.</p>
<p>It'd be one hell of a release on 23rd September, when the movie hit to net, torrent and p2p nearly every eyes on this documentary of a call for action.</p>
<p>Although it's unclear how the download will be released on September 23rd, you can sign up for the download by submitting your email and checking the checkbox "confirming" that you're resided in US or Canada.</p>
