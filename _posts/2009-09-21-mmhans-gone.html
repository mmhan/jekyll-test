<p>For about half a year to a year, the title of the blog was somehow like "mmhan's gone <del datetime="2009-09-21T12:19:48+00:00">comical</del>". You see, my dear reader, as the comic above would suggest, mmhan has been suffering the pitiful disease of ADD. (just jokin... Oh look! there's a squirrel..)</p>
<p>Anyway, this blog has undergone an unannounced hiatus and it has been covered with dust, spider webs and what nots. However, he just received a wake up call. A wake up call that calls him and say, "To Hell with your laziness and excueses, get back to do what you can do a little good. Serve your readers and serve 'em better!".</p>
<p>He thought, "Oh, hell... what's there to lose?", and the another voice answered, "Freaking lots of hours!!".</p>
<p>And then he fell back asleep. Zzzzz....</p>
<p>(I'm just thinking about bringing this blog back to life, and weighting my options. Motivation and time is nowhere to be found when it's much needed.)</p>
