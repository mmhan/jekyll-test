<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>Last week has been quite hectic. My youngest sister has just arrived from Myanmar for her tertiary education and I've been helping her out with all a newly immigrated person would need: a phone line, a bank account and etc.</p>
<p>Me, Rachel, the sister and a bunch of friends scaled the Bukit Timah Hill (537'/164m). Though it's hardly a mountaineering affair, it was quite a fun thing to do. I could imagine myself doing it again (if oppurtunity arises).</p>
<p>As for my dev works, I've started working with Cucumber a lot and also managed to successfully deploy a test application to heroku. Nothing profound though except <a title="~/.code/log : The day that I got stuck" href="http://mmhan.net/personal/thoughts/code-log-the-day-that-i-got-stuck/" target="_blank">a lesson I learnt while I got stuck</a>. I will talk more about it if I found something better to share.</p>
<p>I have shared some links below for your reading pleasure too. Check it out.</p>

<h2>Pick of the week</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323452204578288192043905634.html" target="_blank">Family Inc</a> by Bruce Feiler on WSJ</strong></p>
<p>It's all about when people run their families using Agile methodologies. I have always wondered if I should do the family meetings, establishing accountability and etc. ever since I read 7 habits. This article affirmed my theory. I'm really going to try it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/how-to-rails-3-and-rspec-2-4336.html" target="_blank">How To Get Rails 3 and RSpec 2 Running Specs Fast (From Scratch)</a></strong></p>
<p>This was how I got my Rails to work with RSpec for the first time. I've been using it ever since. (Until I found <a href="http://railsapps.github.com/rails-composer/" target="_blank">rails-composer</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/199qsd/what_exactly_will_meditation_do_for_you/c8nqhw1" target="_blank">What, exactly, will meditation do for you</a></strong></p>
<p>This comment in the Reddit thread gave a concise explanation on how meditation can help you. This comment in my opinion reflect on how I have always felt about meditation and how it could help with the process of Habit #1: Being proactive (from the 7 habits). Check it out and other comments of the whole thread. It's definitely a worthwhile read.</p>
<p>There is even a comment with a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/199qsd/what_exactly_will_meditation_do_for_you/c8otqy3" target="_blank">list of videos</a> that was contributed by commeters as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://tobi.lutke.com/the-apprentice-programmer" target="_blank">The Apprentice Programmer</a></strong></p>
<p>The shopify cofounder TOBI LÜTKE gave us his account on how he dropped out from college and became an apprentice, a vocational education system that is not uncommon in Germany, as a stepping stone to be who he is today. It is definitely a worthwhile read too.</p>
<p>I have also observed that there's a certain tradition that's emerging in the Myanmar's IT industry too. However, it is also disheartening to hear rumors that some of these apprentice are exploited as free labor while some company even go so far as charging the apprentice for working free at their company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.jayway.com/2013/03/03/git-is-a-purely-functional-data-structure/" target="_blank">Git is a purely functional data structure</a></strong></p>
<p>This article gives some insights into how exactly git works with its data structure and how it performs its operations on some of its magically useful features. I am embarrassed to say that I'm still having a hard time trying to grasp the full mechanism in rebasing and merging, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://code.danyork.com/2011/01/25/node-js-doctors-offices-and-fast-food-restaurants-understanding-event-driven-programming/" target="_blank">Node.js, Doctor’s Offices and Fast Food Restaurants – Understanding Event-driven Programming</a></strong></p>
<p>Node.js has been in almost all the things that the tech crowd talk about these days. As a newcomer, this is certainly an eye-opener about how Event-driven programming is taking the stage these days.</p>
<h2>Caught My Attention</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://alistapart.com/blog/post/derailing-security-bugs" target="_blank">De-Railing Security Bugs</a> by Jeff Lembeck on A List Apart</strong></p>
<p>If you have been working with rails for a while and follows related news, this is old news. But if you are like me, who is developing his first rails app, you should take some notes about this<a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/1/8/Rails-3-2-11-3-1-10-3-0-19-and-2-3-15-have-been-released/" target="_blank"> security fix</a> that was released and how you could get it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=QPKKQnijnsM">Wealth Inequality in America</a></strong></p>
<p>[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM[/youtube]</p>
<p>This video will show you that America, the land of oppurtunity has incredibly unbelievable distribution in terms of wealth with the top 1% of the wealthiest people possess the 40% of the total wealth of the US. It made me think, what would a country like ours (Myanmar) would look like. Anyone cares to point out where I could find that data?</p>
<h2>Reference Points</h2>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/zhengjia/428105" target="_blank">Capybara Cheat Sheet</a> by <a href="https://gist.github.com/zhengjia">zhengjia</a></p>
<p>I found this gem (not ruby-gem) while looking around for ways of transversing a DOM for my cucumber tests. Having this link bookmarked was a very good decision, I must say.</p>
<hr />
<p>Right, this is it for now. I'll try to keep note of what I have been reading each week and will present them to you.</p>
<p>For those of you who are questioning my motives on why I would be sharing these mostly irrelevant links again to 2/3 readers who read this, even after I have shared them by twitter, facebook, linkedin and etc, I have a good explanation.</p>
<p>I've tried bookmarks, readability and evernote and what not. But at most time when I read them back, I find myself unable to decipher what I wanted to do with a certain link or material. By posting them this way, I get a more accessible archive of useful materials and links, I get to share them with you about what I think of them and I get a nice little comment of the reason why I find them useful.</p>
<p>However, I am not giving any guarantees of whether or not I will keep doing this. Simply because I don't know if this works better than bookmarks, readability and evernote.</p>
