I've had the oppurtunity to attend a design sprint session for upcoming Myanmar Election related hackathon. It was announced that these guys from, [ASEAN Foundation](http://www.aseanfoundation.org/), have been working on providing an API to create election related apps.

It is almost ready with the following end-points available for you to consume with documentations pending.

### Endpoints Available
- Party
- Geolocation
- Candidate
- FAQ

Check it out!

The API will be definitely useful for the upcoming "မဲပေးစို့" (MaePaySoh) Hack Challenge planned for 5-6 September @[Phandeeyar](http://phandeeyar.org/).
