<p>It's nothing new to tell you that user-generated content trend is on the rise, and obviously <a href="http://www.mediacorp.sg/">MediaCorp</a> has noticed that too. The channel, <a href="http://okto.sg">Okto</a>, will start airing on 19th "Oktober" as an English TV channel contents ranging from International art films, Anime Series and of course, the so-called UGC: User Generated Content.<!--more--></p>
<p>The first series of UGC programs will be clips for channel's idents created by no lesser than NAFA (Nayang Academy of Fine Arts) students. The channel also promises to bring in more exciting programs too.</p>
<p>During my days of school, we had to get our own theater for showcasing some of my course-mates' Final Year Project Videos internally to a small crowd (although Jack Neo himself, was invited and attended the show), it'd definitely help the media students get their exposure to a bigger crowd over a channel which dedicates five time slots a day.</p>
<p>So, if any of you, my friends, is ready to get some exposure, head up to Okto.sg and submit your proud works. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.</p>
