<p>Looks like the mayans had it all wrong, eh? Well, it's not as if they had a great track record for predicting the end of civilizations anyway. They couldn't even predict their own demise, could they?</p>
<p>If you know me and this blog, you know that this is one of those posts that I write in about every 6 months. These days things are changing with the light of speed that my blog hasn't been able to keep up with it much.</p>
<p>Some highlights include that I had attended one of those things. That one where parents rejoice. The same one where loads of photos are taken both by your personal cameras and the professionals with a great cost. The only one where you could dress like a bat and get away with it. Nope, not halloween, the graduation ceremony. Yeah, I had one of those. I figured the forefathers of the academic community thought it's too douchy for one to show off your degree cert to your friends and relatives. Then they put on their thinking hats, sat around a round table a came up with this most elaborate thing called the graduation ceremony. Did I enjoy it? Meh...</p>
<p>Other highlights include that I have started a bit of a teaching/consultant job (mostly related to development). I am quite enjoying it, not only because it pays, but also it's a nice way to revise on some of the things that I already know and discover alternatives solution to the same set of problems.</p>
<p>Starting from tomorrow, I will be a full-time start-up founder of the company behind MyanmarCarsDB.com and MyanmarJobsDB.com among other things.</p>
<p>Just recently, I have picked up a few interesting projects like Android application development and Ruby. (Which I may or may not talk more about in the future)</p>
<p>Things are great and looking up.</p>
<p>To quote Bob Dylan, "The Times They Are A-changing". I'm doing my best with keeping up with it. Let me know if you have been too.</p>
