<p>I was giving a talk today regarding Version Control System at UCSY's (University of Computer Studies Yangon) ITCamp, a BarCamp style unconference organised by the student body. Git was used for showing demo.</p>
<p>Nope, I'm not going to play the same old record of nothing original on the blog about VCS. Just go and google for bazillions of stuffs people have written <a title="Why should I use Version Control?" href="stackoverflow.com/questions/1408450/why-should-i-use-version-control" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="What Is Git &amp; Why You Should Use Version Control If Youâ€™re a Developer" href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/git-version-control-youre-developer/" target="_blank">there</a>.</p>
<p>I'm just going to talk about some experiment I did with the way I presented. Instead of a bunch of code to make commits on, I started out with the following deducted point-to-point script of The Tortoise and the Hare.</p>
<p>[gist id="8596175" file="original"]</p>
<p>And I picked audience at random and let them change anything they like about the story such as emotions, location, the era which the story is taking place, characters and actions. Upon every change I would make commits, introduce mistakes and bla bla, you get the gist.</p>
<p>[gist id="8596175" file="reimagined"]</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="400"]<img alt="" src="assets/rabbit-playing-computer.jpg" width="400" height="300" /> Badass Hare playing DOTA, Sleeping and still winning the race.[/caption]</p>
<p>The resulting story wasn't as spectacular as I expected an improv game such as this to be. I'm not sure if the students were just too shy or they didn't get the gist of the game. Or may be I was just expecting too much out of a 40-minutes section.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed though, it is excruciating for a speaker to get the audience to switch off their broadcast mode and participate in an engaging discussion with the speaker like a BarCamp session is supposed to be.</p>
<p>Perhaps I need to work on my public speaking skills.</p>
<p>Or not having more time to play the game since VCS was taking the whole session to explain was the problem. :P</p>
