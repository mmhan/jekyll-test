<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I'm Myat Min Han, a Multimedia Technology graduate of Singapore Polytechnic. I started blogging in Blogger, <a href="http://mmhan.blogspot.com">Busy Days of mmhan</a>, until my 20th Birthday which I launched this blog and stopped posting on the previous blog.</p>
<p>I've imported a few of the posts that goes with the theme of this new blog, and also some of my favorite posts.</p>
<p>Due to the irregularity of the post rate, I suggest subscribing to my feed, if you think it's worth it.</p>
<p>However, I'm quite an active poster on <a href="http://twitter.com/mmhan">twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.plurk.com/user/mmhan">plurk</a> and <a href="http://mmhan.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a>. So, be sure to check them out and feel free to add me as friend. You'll find many items of sharable quality that I come across on the net.</p>
<p>And yes, that comical guy is supposed to be me. :D</p>
